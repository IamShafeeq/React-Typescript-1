Youâ€™ll learn:
âœ… What nested routes are and why we use them
âœ… How layout routes help us create shared layouts (like navigation bars or side menus)
âœ… How to define nested routes in App.tsx

âœ… How to organize nested routes into folders and components


1. What are Nested Routes?

Letâ€™s imagine a simple app:

/dashboard
/dashboard/profile
/dashboard/settings


- All these pages share the same layout â€” maybe a sidebar and a top navigation bar.
-Without nested routes, youâ€™d have to repeat the same layout in every component ðŸ˜©
- With nested routes, you define a parent route (/dashboard) and inside it, you define child routes (profile, settings).

That way:

The parent component renders the layout (like navbar, sidebar, etc.)

The child component renders the page content inside it
